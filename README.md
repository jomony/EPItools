# EPItools
Comparison of the performance of epigenetic (bisulfite-) data mapping and analysis tools.

Evaluation of four distinct epigenomic mapping tools - including the main scripts to search for coherence and over-laps of mapped reads from each tool (Omony, Nussbaumer and Gutzat, in Review).

- **Bismark**
- **BSMap**
- **BS-Seeker3**
- **segemehl**

The benchmark tests incuded the dicots Arabidosis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata and Glycine max while also 
monocots Triticum aestivum and Oryza sativa.

The github repository contains all single scripts but also the scripts to run
all four tools together for each of the five genomes.
In addition, we added a script that is used to simulate epigenomic reads and also for running the above four mapping tools.
The tool by **Sherman** (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Sherman) was used for the simulation.
The simulation and performance of the tools have been described in our study (Omony, Nussbaumer and Gutzat, in Review).
