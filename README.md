# EPItools
Comparison of the performance of epigenetic (bisulfite-) data mapping and analysis tools.

Evaluation of four distinct epigenomic mapping tools - including the main scripts to search for coherence and over-laps of mapped reads from each tool (Omony, Nussbaumer and Gutzat, in Review).

- **Bismark**
- **BSMap**
- **BS-Seeker3**
- **segemehl**

The script is provided to simulate epigenomic reads and for running the above four mapping tools.
For the simulation the tool by **Sherman** (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Sherman) was used.
