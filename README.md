# EPItools
Comparison of the performance of epigenetic (bisulfite-) data mapping and analysis tools.

Evaluation of four distinct epigenomic mapping tools - including the main scripts to search for coherence and over-laps of mapped reads from each tool (Omony, Nussbaumer and Gutzat, in Review).

- Bismark.
- Bsmap.
- BS-seeker3.
- segemehl.

In addition, the script is provided to simulate epigenomic reads and then to use the for running the four mapping tools.
For the simulation the tool Sherman (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Sherman) has been used.
